## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

This project was a really god one for practicing the layout, had a lot of fun building it and i think it improved my skills and mainly speed greatly. This time i did not choose the mobile-first approach because i dont think it needed it. It is fully responsible with minimal media querries. I tried to create a one to one replication of the project so did not add anything to it, i am here to learn replicating from designs and not creating the design itself.

### Continued development

I don't plan to improve the code of this project, i'm happy with the result. I will continue to learn about Grid and Flexbox, and i will try to use them more effectively in my future projects.
